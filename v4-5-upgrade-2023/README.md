## Upgrade overview
Upgrading the detection objectives of your mesoSPIM can significantly boost your system resolution, while using newer cSMOS cameras (e.g. Teledyne Photometrics Iris 15 or Kinetix) can aditionally boost your throughput.

The suggested upgrade requires 5 Mitutoyo Plan Apo objectives (2x, 5x, 7.5x, 10x, 20x), a motorized turret, a compact filter wheel, mounting hardware, and, optionally, a large-sensor sCMOS camera (we recommend Teledyne Photometrics Iris 15).
