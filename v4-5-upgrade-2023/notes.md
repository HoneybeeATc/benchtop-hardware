## Ludl filter wheel
There are several problems with Ludl:
* they are bulky
* require custom adapters for Thorlabs SM2 lens tube
* over time the plastic belt can get torn
* require dedicated COM card and configuring COM port (which can change after Windows update)

## Zwo EFWmini filter wheel
Several advantages:
* small and low-cost (200$ vs 6k for Ludl)
* works from USB
* takes up filters up to 31 mm
* easy mechanical interface with T-mounts on each side, available from Thorlabs
